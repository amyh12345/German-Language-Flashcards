## General Info
I've created German Language flashcards using Tkinter. These flashcards are a GUI (graphical user interface). The aim of these flashcards is to test ones knowledge of German language, and aid in vocab memorisation. 

## Technologies 
 - Python
 - Visual Studio Code
 - Tkinter
   
## Final Product
You can find the final prototype for this app in the file titled 'German Flashcards App'. 

## Drafts and Initial prototypes
I have also provided other prototypes for my app which helped me to get to my final product. 
'make frame.py' and 'opening page.py' both were originally intended to by my home page for the app. I ultimately decided to use tabs instead. 
The file 'first draft.py' was the first draft of the app.

## Set up
Install Python and Tkinter

## Features
 - Learn German language at a beginners level
 - Features 3 sets of flashcards
 - Learn the gender of nouns with the 'Guess the gender' flashcard set

## Inspiration
This app is based on a Spanish Language Flashcards app tutorial by Tkinter.com.
Aspects of this app were also made using 'The ultimate introduction to modern GUIs in Python', a YouTube tutorial by Clear Code.
