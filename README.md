I've created German Language flashcards using Tkinter. These flashcards are a GUI (graphical user interface). You can find the final prototype for this app in the file titled 'German Flashcards App'. 


I have also provided other prototypes for my app which helped me to get to my final product. 'make frame.py' and 'opening page.py' both were originally intended to by my home page for the app. I ultimately decided to use tabs instead. 


Finally, the file 'first draft.py' was the first draft of the app.
